# AirBnb_Seattle-Project

## Project Motivation

I was interested in exploring the AirBnB dataset for Seattle. I wanted to better understand the pricing trends, review sentiments and pricing prediction. Some of the questions that I have analyzed are:

1. How does the pricing increase or decrease by season?
2. What is the peak season in Seattle?
3. How does the pricing increase or decrease by neighborhood?
4. Which ones are the priciest neighborhoods in Seattle?
5. How does property types within neighborhoods impact price for the most expensive neighborhoods and most common property types?
6. How can we categorize reviews based on sentiments?
7.Can we map positive and negative sentiments from reviews to neighborhoods to understand which neighborhoonds rank higher on the positive sentiment scale and which ones rank higher on the negative sentiment scale?
8.Can we explore some of the worst reviews for additional insights?
9.Can we predict a price for a given listing?
10.What factors of the listing correlate best for predicting the price?
